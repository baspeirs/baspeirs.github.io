To get started, let me give you a brief overview of myself. Things I love include music, gaming, baseball, animals, and memes. Baseball and video games have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, my family has always had dogs and cats, and humor has always been number 1 around me. I started playing music after highschool, and played some live shows while I was in college. Lastly, I started learning to code at the end of 2019 when I decided i was due for a career change.</p></div>

              <p>This is my dog Lucky. She was born in my Mom's kitchen in 2008 with 6 other puppies, but this one stood out. As a pup, she loved to play! Her favorite game was called "La Chupacabra" which we would attatch a small blinking light to her collar and have her chase us around the yard at night. To this day however, her favorite activity is begging for popcorn.</p>
